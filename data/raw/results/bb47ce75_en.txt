4,4’-Dinitro-3,3’-diazenofuroxan (DDF) is a powerful experimental high explosive with performance comparable to that of other high-density high-explosives such as octanitrocubane. It is synthesised by oxidative coupling of 4-amino-3-(azidocarbonyl)furoxan followed by Curtius rearrangement and further oxidation.
