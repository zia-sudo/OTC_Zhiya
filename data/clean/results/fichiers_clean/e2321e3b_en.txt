The J.E. Squiers House, also known as the Squiers Manor Bed and Breakfast, is a historic building located in Maquoketa, Iowa, United States. The architectural and historic significance of this house is attributed to its being "a well-preserved example of late nineteenth century domestic architecture in Maquoketa's most prominent residential neighborhood and for its association with the life and career of James Emery Squiers, a prominent local businessman." Built in 1882, the 21‚ÅÑ2-story brick house features elements consistent with the Queen Anne and Stick styles. It follows a central hall floor plan with two rectangular projecting bays, a three-sided bay window, a kitchen addition on the back, and a hipped roof with intersecting gable sections.
