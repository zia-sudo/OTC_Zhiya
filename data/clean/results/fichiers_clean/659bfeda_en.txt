Jacob of Serugh, also called Jacob of Sarug or Mar Jacob, was one of the foremost Syriac poet-theologians, perhaps only second in stature to Ephrem the Syrian and equal to Narsai. He lived most of his life as an ecclesiastical official in Suru√ß, located in modern-day Turkey. He would finally become a bishop near the end of his life in 519. He belonged to a Miaphysite or Non-Chalcedonian Christianity, although he was fairly moderate compared to a number of his contemporaries.
